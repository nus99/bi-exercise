Greetings, 

I have attached the technical test. Two JSON files are included: "Home" and "Details," each displaying a dashboard. 
"Home" provides general information about the device, "Details" provides more accurate information regarding alerts. 

It presents information on a device's performance, and if it is not optimal, one can access the detail file to see which 
alerts have failed. The detail file offers further insight, with data organized by month and day. I have tried to follow the thread 
of the dashboard report and have included various filters to optimise the user experience.

Additionally, I have uploaded two jrxml files titled bi-main and bi-details. As in the previous case, the initial report provides 
a board overview meanwhile the second report goes into more depth.

The first report outlines which devices achieve optimum performance, whereas the second report offers further details about the alerts. 
Each device has been separated onto a distinct page using parameters and groups for clarification purposes. 

If you have any queries or require additional help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks in advance.
Iago Nus.
